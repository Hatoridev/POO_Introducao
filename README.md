# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Introduction

Repository with small examples and projects introducing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## How to Run:

1. **Android (Termux):**

   - Update and upgrade Termux:
   
     ```bash
     apt update && apt upgrade
     ```
   
   - Install necessary programming languages:
   
     - Python:
       ```bash
       pkg install python
       ```
     
     - C# (mono):
       ```bash
       pkg install mono
       ```
     
     - C++:
       ```bash
       pkg install clang
       ```
     
     - Java:
       ```bash
       pkg install openjdk-11
       ```
   
   - Clone the repository:
   
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Hatoridev/POO_Introducao.git
     ```
   
   - Navigate to the cloned directory:
   
     ```bash
     cd POO_Introducao
     ```
   
   - Execute Python files:
   
     ```bash
     python filename.py
     ```
   
     (Replace "filename.py" with the name of the Python file you want to execute)

   - Execute C# files (files with .cs extension):
   
     ```bash
     mcs filename.cs && mono filename.exe
     ```
   
     (Replace "filename.cs" with the name of the C# file you want to compile and execute)

   - Execute C++ files (files with .cpp extension):
   
     ```bash
     clang++ -o filename filename.cpp && ./filename
     ```
   
     (Replace "filename.cpp" with the name of the C++ file you want to compile and execute)

   - Execute Java files (files with .java extension):
   
     ```bash
     javac filename.java && java filename
     ```
   
     (Replace "filename.java" with the name of the Java file you want to compile and execute)

2. **Windows:**

   - Install necessary programming languages from their respective official websites.
   
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the cloned directory.
   
   - Execute Python, C++, C#, and Java files as mentioned above.

3. **Debian / Linux:**

   - Update the system:
   
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
     ```
   
   - Install necessary programming languages:
   
     - Python:
       ```bash
       sudo apt install python
       ```
     
     - C# (mono):
       ```bash
       sudo apt install mono-complete
       ```
     
     - C++:
       ```bash
       sudo apt install g++
       ```
     
     - Java:
       ```bash
       sudo apt install default-jdk
       ```
   
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the cloned directory.
   
   - Execute Python, C++, C#, and Java files as mentioned above.
